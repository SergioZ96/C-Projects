/*
	File Copier Program
	Through the command line, takes as input the program, input file for copying,
	and output file, to paste the content onto
	Requirements: 
	Program should only call read() and write() system calls to read and write files.
	  C library functions such as fread() and fwrite() are not allowed

	How much content is read from the file every time (each read() call) should be 
	  determined by an argument of the program. The pathname of the existing file and the 
	  pathname of the new file should also be specified through arguments of the program. 
	  The format of the command for running the program is as follows:

	  ./hw1_1 -n #bytes -i pathname_existing_file -o pathname_new_file  

	  		#bytes: the number of bytes each read() system call reads from the existing file 
	  		(it is also the number of bytes each write() system call writes into the new file).

	  		pathname_existing_file: the pathname of the existing file

			pathname_new_file: the pathname of the new file.

	Your program should be able to handle the following common errors: 1) opening a non_existent file, 
	  2) creating a file in a directory where you have no access.

	The new file should be identical to the existing file when the program finishes running.
